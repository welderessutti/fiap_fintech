<h1>DeedsCash Fiap Fintech Project</h1>
<p>This is my FIAP College Project called DeedsCash.</p>
<p>It´s a fintech prototype developed using only HTML5, CSS3 with Bootstrap5 at the moment. Currently there are only three pages built, the sign in page, the sing up page and the main page. All of them have desktop and mobile browser layout versions, focused in the mobile first concept.</p>
<p>The next step in the project, is to develop the core JavaScript front-end. It´s going to have a JS framework like React too.</p>
<p>By the end of 2023, the project will be ready for its desktop version. In the next year 2024, I´ll start the development of mobile version, using mobile tools and languages like Kotlin and Swift.</p>
